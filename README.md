Visualizing Licensed Driver Demographics
📌 Project Title: Visual Insights into U.S. Driver License Demographics

🧠 Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform simple data cleaning and create two meaningful visualizations using a publicly available dataset of licensed drivers in the United States.
We aim to analyze and visualize:
The distribution of drivers by gender (bar chart)
The distribution of drivers by age group (histogram-style bar chart)

📂 Dataset Used:
Title: Licensed Drivers by State, Gender, and Age Group
Source: Data.gov (U.S. Department of Transportation)
Format: Excel/CSV
Columns: year, sex, cohort, state, drivers

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps:
Removed rows with missing values in the drivers column
Standardized column names for easier access
Converted drivers column to numeric (if necessary)
Ensured all gender and age group entries are valid

📊 Visualizations:
1. Bar Chart – Drivers by Gender
Compares total number of male vs. female licensed drivers

2. Histogram-style Bar Chart – Drivers by Age Group
Shows the distribution of licensed drivers across different age cohorts (e.g., 16–20, 21–24, ...)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

✅ Outcome:
Discovered which gender has more licensed drivers
Identified age groups with the highest number of licensed driversProduced clean and easy-to-read bar charts
